    "Qiskit is IBM's quantum computing library. It is one of the most popular packages out there (especially for beginners) but certainly not the only one. Google has Cirque, Microsoft has Q#, Xanadu has Pennylane (good for QML), Rigetti has PyQuil, and there are more. There are a bunch of similarities and differences between them and we will stick primarily with qiskit but we encourage you to explore and experiment with others\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, qiskit initializes all qubits to $|0\\rangle$. When building a qunatum program in qiskit, you typically start by with `qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits, n_cbits)` which instantiates a quantum circuit object with a however many qubits and classical bits you want. You can then add gates to the circuit with a commands that follow the structure `qc.gate(qubit)`. This would apply whatever gate you specified in `gate` (e.g. `x` or `h`) to the specified qubit index. Here are some common gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "    qc.x(0)      # rotation by Pi around the x-axis\n",
