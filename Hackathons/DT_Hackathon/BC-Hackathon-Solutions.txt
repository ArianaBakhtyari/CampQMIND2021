# Blockchain Hackathon

For this hackathon, we will ask you to fill in some template code to create  blockchain-based crowdfunding application by leveraging smart contracts

## How to get the solution:

1. Copy the link below:
```
https://github.com/openberry-ac/crowdfunding/blob/master/contracts/Crowdfunding.sol

```

2. Go to the site linked below:

https://remix.ethereum.org/

3. You should be in the Remix editor with a general home tab welcoming you in the middle, a directory in the left column and some sort of terminal in the bottom. Below the `Featured Plugins` and `File` sections, you will see a row of buttons under `Load From` that say `Gist`, `GitHub`, and more. Click the `GitHub` option.

4. Paste the link you copied in part 1 into the window that popped up.

5. Click `OK`.

6. Cick that `github` folder, then keep clicking to fin the `Crowdfunding.sol` file. This is the completed version.
