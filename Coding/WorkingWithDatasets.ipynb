    "Alright, so I guess we haven't really come to a conclusion. It is obvious that most students don't drink profusely throughout the week, and the highest marks come from the ones that drink the least. But the worst marks also come from the students who drink the least. It appears that the amount of drinking that you do has little effect on the marks of these students. But it is important to remember that coming to this conclusion after plotting three graphs with i highly skewed dataset isn't at all a valid finding. This dataset is made up of 400 portugese students who go to an affluent highschool and who live in a place where drinking alcohol is legal at their ages. It would require a lot more work with a lot more data to come to any valid conclusions. I hope you have learned a bit more about working with data, and I would recommend checking out the many datasets on kaggle if you're interested in more!"
