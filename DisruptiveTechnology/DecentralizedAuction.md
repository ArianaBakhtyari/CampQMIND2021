# Decentralized Auction

For this workshop, we will walk you through how to create a blockchain-based auction application by leveraging smart contracts.


## How to begin

1. Copy the link below:
```
https://gist.github.com/BhavanS99/7b95e7620726c9771f8bf8da612088d8
```

2. Go to the site linked below:

https://remix.ethereum.org/

3. You should be in the Remix editor with a general home tab welcoming you in the middle, a directory in the left column and some sort of terminal in the bottom. Below the `Featured Plugins` and `File` sections, you will see a row of buttons under `Load From` that say `Gist`, `GitHub`, and more. Click the `Gist` option.

4. Paste the link you copied in part 1 into the window that popped up.

5. Click `OK`.

6. In the workspace directory in the column on the left, you should now see a new folder that looks like a bunch of gibberish - that means you did it! Cick that folder, then click `contracts`, and then open `Voting_Empty.sol`.

7. And you are done! We will be going through how to fill this file in in the workshop.
