# Decentralized Auction

For this workshop, we will walk you through how to create a blockchain-based auction application by leveraging smart contracts.


## How to begin

1. Copy the link below:
```

https://github.com/mustafa-tariqk/qmind-workshop/blob/main/Auction.sol

```

2. Go to the site linked below:

https://remix.ethereum.org/

3. You should be in the Remix editor with a general home tab welcoming you in the middle, a directory in the left column and some sort of terminal in the bottom. Below the `Featured Plugins` and `File` sections, you will see a row of buttons under `Load From` that say `Gist`, `GitHub`, and more. Click the `GitHub` option.

4. Paste the link you copied in part 1 into the window that popped up.

5. Click `OK`.

6. Cick that `github` folder, then click `mustafa-tariqk`, and then open `Auction.sol`.

7. And you are done! We will be going through how to fill this file in in the workshop.
